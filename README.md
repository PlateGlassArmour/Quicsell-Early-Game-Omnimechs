# Quicsell-Early-Game-Omnimechs
 
Work in progress items and mechs for a (hopefully upcoming) RogueTech content pack

Weapons and gear are all currently very rough ideas. Further ballancing still to be done.

Current plans for mechs: one mech type for each chassis tonnage from 20 tons to 100 tons, with four variants each; a total of 68 mechs.

## Mechs:  
### Lights:   
20- Wasp-WSP  
25- Commoando-COM  
30- Valkyrie-VLK  
35- Panther-PNT  
### Mediums:  
40- Vulcan-VL  
45- Vindicator-VND  
50- Trebuchet-TBT  
55- Wolverine-WVT  
### Heavies:  
60- Quickdraw-QKD  
65- Thunderbolt-TDR  
70- Grasshopper-GHR  
75- Black Knight-BL  
### Assaults:  
80- Charger-CGR  
85- Battlemaster-BLR  
90- Highlander-HGN  
95- Banshee-BNC  
100- Mackie-MSK  

Mech variety will primarily come from different combinations of primary rolls, primary armaments, and engine types.  
Each mech type will have one variant of each roll, and one variant of each primary armament (see MechVariation.XLS for more details)

### Rolls are:  
1- Sniper (low armour, long range, high damage)  
2- Brawler (high armour, short range, very survivable)  
3- Backstabber (low to medium armour, short to medium range, highly mobile)  
4- Support (low to medium armour, medium to long range, support weapons and equipment, generally low direct damage)
Mech variant names will be defined by their roll. (COM-QS1 will be the sniper, COM-QS2 will be the Brawler, etc.)

### Primary Armaments are:  
1- Ballistic  
2- Laser  
3- PPC  
5- Missile  

### Engine Types (with aproximate proportion of mech pool that uses said types):  
1- XL!! (8/17)  
2- normal fusion (2/17)  
3- ICE XL (2/17)  
4- fuel cell (2/17)  
5- ICE (2/17)  
6- other (1/17)  
This mix means that there is about a 60% chance that any given mech variant chosen will have the XL vulnerability. Enough to notice the pattern, but not enough to rely on.
